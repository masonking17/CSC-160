First time programming, not really sure what I'm doing but oh well.

  <h2> My Cause </h2>
  <p>
    Baseball is the biggest reason why I am at Centre. I was presented the opportunity to play baseball and along with the high academics
    and study abroad program, Centre ended up being the best place for me. People choose their college based on numerous things, but my
    decision was based primarily on sports. I could have gone elsewhere just to focus on my academics, but I wanted to continue my athletic
    career because I have a big passion for sports. After arriving on campus, I have begun to realize that this was the best decision I have
    made and that it will be well worth it in the end.
