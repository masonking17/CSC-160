  <h1> My Cause </h1>
  <p>
    Baseball is the biggest reason why I am at Centre. I was presented the opportunity to play baseball
    and along with the high academics and study abroad program, Centre ended up being the best place for
    me. People choose their college based on numerous things, but my decision was based primarily on sports.
    I could have gone elsewhere just to focus on my academics, but I wanted to continue my athletic career 
    because I have a big passion for sports. After arriving on campus, I have begun to realize that this was
    the best decision I have made and that it will be well worth it in the long run.

<h1> Software Engineer Essay </h1>
<body>
<p>
    After reading the syllabus and watching the video, I was very surprised by Mayuko's description of a software engineer. She repeatedly
  stated that as a software engineer, you must be true to yourself and incorporate your own personal identity into your career. Mayuko also
  spoke on the idea that soft skills are much more important than technical skills as a software engineer because it allows you to work 
  better as a team member. These soft skills, also known as "people skills" or "interpersonal skills" include:
  <ul>
    <li> communication </li> 
    <li> flexibility </li>
    <li> leadership </li>
    <li> teamwork </li>
    <li> time management </li>
  </ul>
    Being well rounded and personable helps greatly with working effectively with your colleagues. Software engineers also aim to uphold certain core values that promote their company's standards. Soft skills are essential to this because 
  they allow engineers to work together cohesively and effectively complete assignments and projects. Software engineers must balance their 
  technical skills and soft skills in order to get along well with their colleagues and complete their proejects well and efficiently. These
  values can be seen in our class syllabus in the way that communication and cooperativeness between students are essential to effectively
  completing assignments and to learn from fellow classmates.

    Our class syllabus reflects many values included in the video. The syllabus encourages classmates to work together and help each other
  learn in the process. This idea is reflected by Mayuko when she talks about team cooperation in the workplace. In class, we are expected 
  to assess the work of our peers to help gain a better understanding of the content and also to learn from each other's mistakes. This is 
  crucial to both teambuilding and overall learning because it allows you to see your mistakes before you turn in an assignment and gives 
  you the opportunity to learn from the mistakes and fix it for future use. One thing that is in the video but could be included in the syllabus
  is that no student is the exact same as another. Students should embrace their own unique personalities and use their strengths to their advantage
  but also work on their weaknesses to become better well-rounded. This is essential to being succesful and allows students to work together and \
  combine their skills to learn from one another and also produce higher quality work. All in all, each student will learn and complete their work
  in different ways to be most succesful. It is ultimately up to the students to push each other and help one another be successful both inside
  and outside of the classroom.
